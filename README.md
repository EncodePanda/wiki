["An Introduction to Dependent Typing in Scala"](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/9045-an-introduction-to-dependent-typing-in-scala) - A brief introduction to Dependent Types in Scala. Nice 101 examples with `List` and `map` function. Inspiring comment from Miles Sabin.

## Lenses
["Assymetric Lenses"](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/3257-asymmetric-lenses-scala) Runar introduces gently concept of lenses.

["Free as in Monads by Daniel Spiewak"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKUQUIHRGec) Daniel Spiewak makes live coding session implementing Free monad. Interesting to see how 'the most interesting things in FP actually don't do much really'.
